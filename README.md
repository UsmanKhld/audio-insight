# AudioInsight

## Overview 🎙️

This groundbreaking project revolutionizes the way we interact with audio content. By seamlessly processing audio files and transforming them into searchable, interactive experiences, it opens up a world of possibilities. With the ability to convert podcast MP3 files into text using Whisper and offering question-answering through embeddings stored in Pinecone, this system empowers users to effortlessly engage with and extract valuable insights from podcast content. It's time to experience audio in a whole new way.

## Key Features ✨

- **Audio Chunking**: Podcast MP3 files are split into smaller audio chunks for better handling and processing
- **Speech-to-Text**: Using Whisper, each audio chunk is transcribed into text, ensuring high-quality transcription
- **Q&A System**: Users can ask questions based on the podcast transcript. The system uses the transcript's embeddings to return accurate answers
- **Embeddings with Pinecone**: Text chunks are embedded into vector format and stored in Pinecone for quick retrieval during the question-answering process

## Project Workflow 🔄

1. **Upload Podcast MP3**: The user uploads a podcast MP3 file
2. **Chunking**: The MP3 file is split into smaller chunks
3. **Speech-to-Text**: Each chunk is transcribed into text using the Whisper model
4. **Embeddings Generation**: The transcribed text is split into smaller chunks and converted into embeddings using sentence-transformers or other embedding models
5. **Storing Embeddings**: The embeddings are stored in Pinecone, a vector database for fast retrieval
6. **Question Answering**: Users can ask questions based on the podcast, and the system retrieves relevant chunks using Pinecone embeddings to provide accurate answers

## Project Architecture 🏗️

1. **Podcast MP3 → MP3 Chunks**: The MP3 is split into smaller audio chunks
2. **Speech-to-Text Conversion**: Whisper converts these audio chunks into text
3. **Embeddings Generation**: Text chunks are converted into vector embeddings for storage
4. **Embeddings Storage (Pinecone)**: Vector embeddings are stored and managed in Pinecone
5. **Interactive Q&A**: Users can ask questions and receive answers from the embedded text data

## Requirements 📋

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Virtual environment management tool (venv, conda, etc.)
- All dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation and Setup 🛠️

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash

python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Using conda

```bash
# Create conda environment
conda create -n venv python=3.12

# Activate conda environment
conda activate venv
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
# Make sure your virtual environment is activated
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Streamlit app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### 5. Usage

Upload a podcast MP3 and interact with the transcription through the Q&A interface.
